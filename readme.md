# Time Management Assistant

Time Management Assistant is an intelligent assistant designed to optimize task prioritization using Reinforcement Learning (RL). It takes the number of tasks, their names, and priorities as input and outputs a well-organized, ordered task list to help you manage your time more effectively.

## Features

- **Dynamic Task Prioritization**: Uses RL to optimize the sequence of tasks based on given priorities.
- **Simple Input**: Accepts the number of tasks, task names, and their priorities.
- **Efficient Output**: Produces an ordered list that ensures optimal task management.
- **Customizable Algorithm**: Allows modification of the RL-based optimization algorithm for specific user needs.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide the number of tasks, task names, and priority values.
2. **Processing**: The RL model analyzes the input and determines the best order of execution for your tasks.
3. **Output**: An ordered list of tasks is presented, tailored for efficient time management.
